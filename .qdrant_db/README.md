# Qdrant Vector Database

This directory locally stores the collections and vectors generated by the research pipeline. 
Since the database binaries and content can be large and contain copyrighted or sensitive material from ingested files, they are omitted from version control.

These files will populate automatically at runtime when the pipeline runs successfully.
