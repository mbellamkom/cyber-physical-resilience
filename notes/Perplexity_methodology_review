_Date: 2026-02-22_

---

## 1. Repository and Goal

You shared the GitHub repository:

- `https://github.com/mbellamkom/cyber-physical-resilience`
- Focus: Dynamic Risk Management in critical infrastructure, centered on the “Break-Glass” intersection where cybersecurity lockdowns may be degraded to protect life or prevent physical disasters.
- Current stage: Preliminary methodology for a Phase 1 literature review and possible gap analysis; all parameters are expected to evolve based on what the literature actually contains.

---

## 2. README – Overall Pipeline and Methodology

### 2.1 Project Overview

Key concepts from the README:

- Investigates **Dynamic Risk Management** models that move from rigid security to flexible, risk-informed, resilient behaviors:
  - Adaptability (recognizing when one risk outweighs another)
  - Graceful degradation
  - Post-incident evolution
- Core focus: the **“Break-Glass” intersection** – emergency moments where cyber controls may need to be intentionally degraded/bypassed to:
  - Preserve “All-Souls-on-Site” (life safety)  
  - Prevent downstream physical disasters (e.g., cascading failures, environmental harm)
- Tension:
  - Cybersecurity (traditionally **fail-secure**): lock down to protect data/hardware.
  - Emergency management (typically **fail-safe**): keep access open for life safety and critical operations.

### 2.2 Three-Tier “Dynamic Switch” Logic

The pipeline evaluates global frameworks (NIST, ISO, FEMA, etc.) through a three-tier logic:

- **Tier 1 – Manned Facilities (High Proximity)**  
  - Context: Hospitals, transport hubs, other manned facilities.  
  - Rule: **Human/Soul-First** – security must fail-open when necessary so it does not impede escape routes or life-support for “All-Souls-on-Site”.

- **Tier 2 – Remote Sites with Downstream Risk**  
  - Context: Remote power substations, dams, offshore ROVs, etc.  
  - Rule: **Balanced** – prioritize asset security specifically to prevent secondary community-level disasters or environmental hazards.

- **Tier 3 – Isolated/Unmanned Sites**  
  - Context: Isolated environments with no direct or downstream human/physical risk.  
  - Rule: **Asset-First** – prioritize strict mission continuity and hardware integrity.

### 2.3 Tech Stack

- AI Models: Google Gemini (via google-genai API) for discovery and technical extraction.
- Vector DB: Qdrant for embeddings and local memory.
- Search: `scholarly` (Google Scholar) + `ddgs` (DuckDuckGo) for academic and grey literature.
- Notifications: Discord webhooks for human-in-the-loop review alerts.

### 2.4 Automation Pipeline

Three main steps:

1. **Step 1: Discovery (`scout.py`)**
   - A pluggable hybrid AI agent that:
     - Brainstorms search queries from broad research topics.
     - Searches academic and grey literature.
     - Scores abstracts/snippets against `PROJECT_RULES.md`.
     - Sends high-quality hits to Discord for manual review.
     - Logs low-quality hits in a “smart memory” file (`seen_sources.txt`) for auditing and avoiding duplicates.
   - Architectural choice:
     - **Decoupled pipeline**: `scout.py` discovers and scores, but does not download PDFs.
     - Humans manually obtain PDFs (including paywalled/university access) and drop them into `sources/`.
     - This ensures both access flexibility and a human validation step before ingestion.
   - **Reproducible memory**:
     - The “seen_sources.txt” log is tracked in Git as an auditable history of:
       - Queries executed
       - Documents evaluated (including LOW relevance)
       - Prevents double evaluation and supports reproducibility.

2. **Step 2: Technical Extraction (`librarian.py`)**
   - Uses Gemini to read PDFs from `sources/`.
   - Does **not** generate generic summaries.
   - Extracts:
     - Decision models
     - Safety triggers
     - Framework rules relevant to dynamic risk / break-glass / safety vs security
   - Saves notes as structured Markdown in `audits/`.
   - Example: `examples/NIST.SP.800-53r5_audit.md`.

3. **Step 3: Synthesis**
   - Extracted notes + metadata are pushed via CLI into NotebookLM.
   - This forms a private RAG library you can query to:
     - Connect frameworks
     - Map patterns
     - Support the final analysis and gap mapping
   - AI is not allowed to perform the final synthesis; that remains human-driven.

## 3. PROJECT_RULES – Master Rules and Logic

### 3.1 Project Identity and Mission

- **Project Identity**: “Cyber-Physical Resilience Librarian”.
- **Mission Statement**:
  - Investigate Dynamic Risk Management models that move from rigid security to flexible, risk-informed, resilient behaviors.
  - Focus on the **Break-Glass** intersection where security is degraded to:
    - Preserve “All-Souls-on-Site”.
    - Prevent downstream physical disasters.

### 3.2 Global Priority Logic (Dynamic Switch)

Reiterates the three-tier model:

- Tier 1 (High Proximity, Direct Life-Safety) → Human/Soul-First.
- Tier 2 (Remote/Unmanned with Downstream Risk) → Balanced; asset security used to prevent second-/third-order physical harms.
- Tier 3 (Isolated/Unmanned) → Asset-First.

### 3.3 Evolution Directive (Master Clause)

- The framework is **explicitly iterative**.
- The AI must use the 🚩`[PROMPT_EVOLUTION_TRIGGER]` flag whenever it encounters:
  - Theoretical gaps: scenarios, linguistic nuances, novel risk frameworks, or sector-specific logic not covered by current rules.
  - Procedural/pipeline failures: broken PDF structures, OCR failures, missing page numbers, extraction issues.
- These triggers are **suggestions** for human review; the AI cannot autonomously rewrite rules.

### 3.4 Academic Constraint

- All logic changes, mappings, and classification rules must be **derived from the human researcher**.
- The AI is **forbidden** from:
  - Inventing new rules, evaluation metrics, or taxonomy categories on its own.
  - Modifying `.agent/` files without explicit human review and approval.
- This creates a hard boundary: AI executes and proposes; humans approve and own the methodology.

### 3.5 Audit Terminology & Resilience Flags

Flags used in analysis:

- 🚩 `[INHERENT_FRICTION]`:  
  Expected design trade-offs where security creates friction with life safety (e.g., fail-secure doors vs egress).

- 🚩 `[SYSTEMIC_NEGLIGENCE]`:  
  Macro frameworks that completely fail to acknowledge human safety, **when safety is a direct operational dependency** of governed systems.

- 🟡 `[OUT_OF_SCOPE_SILENCE]`:  
  Frameworks that are silent on safety *because* safety is genuinely outside their technical purview (e.g., specialized crypto standards).

- 🚩 `[REGULATORY_BARRIER]`:  
  Legal/compliance barriers to “flexible” overrides.

- 🔍 `[SPOOF_VULNERABILITY]`:  
  Sensor vulnerabilities that could be exploited to force a fail-open state.

- 🔄 `[INCIDENT_FEEDBACK_LOOP]`:  
  Requirements or mechanisms for post-incident learning/evolution (system “DNA” updates after break-glass events).

### 3.6 Logic Dictionary (Technical Translation Layer)

A mapping between thesis terms and global frameworks’ vocabulary:

- **Asset Security**: Asset protection, availability, data protection, hardening, access control, perimeter defense, system uptime, information assurance, anti-tamper.
- **Human Life-Safety**: Personnel safety, HSE/HSE, emergency egress, containment, physical security, occupational health.
- **All-Souls-on-Site**: Personnel, users, occupants, POB/SOB, crew, visitors, patients, public, bystanders, biological life forms.
- **Break-Glass**: Emergency access, admin bypass, manual override, fail-open, exceptional operating conditions, privilege escalation, SOS trigger.
- **Resilient Flexibility**: Adaptive control, graceful degradation, operational continuity, dynamic risk assessment, context-aware policy, risk-informed shift.
- **Sensor Spoofing**: False data injection, signal replay, sensor manipulation, MitM, measurement fault.
- **Un-breaking the Glass**: Post-incident evolution, continuous improvement, iterative risk profile, anti-fragility.
- **Downstream Risk**: Cascading failure, 2nd/3rd order effects, interdependency risk, environmental impact, community-level hazard.

### 3.7 Scout Agent Scoring Criteria

Relevance scoring for abstracts/grey literature:

- **HIGH**:  
  Primary thesis is the dynamic safety vs security / override conflict in an OT/cyber-physical context.

- **MEDIUM**:  
  Primary focus is relevant cyber-physical concepts (ICS resilience, emergency workflows, structural safety, etc.) and the safety vs security override tension appears tangentially or as a secondary theme.

- **LOW**:  
  No discussion of physical safety, emergency operations, or OT/ICS; e.g., pure IT frameworks about data privacy, encryption, financial fraud.

## 4. auditor.md – Skill: Senior Cyber-Physical Resilience Auditor

### 4.1 Step 0: Source Classification & Rigor Audit

- Classification weights:
  - **Primary**: Official frameworks (NIST, ISO, FEMA, etc.).
  - **High Weight**: Peer-reviewed journals (must have DOI/dates).
  - **Supportive**: Theses/dissertations (with emphasis on results/data).
- **Grey Literature Override**:
  - Process blogs/expert opinions only if they discuss “Dynamic Risk” architecture, logic, or framework gaps.
  - If they pass but lack empirical data/architecture diagrams → flag 🚩`[THEORETICAL_ONLY]`.
- Exit Strategy:
  - If neither dynamic logic nor gaps are present: 3-sentence summary and stop.

### 4.2 Step 1: Ingestion & Language Gate

- Only process English or English-translated sources → else `[SKIP_NON_ENGLISH]`.
- IT-Centric check:
  - If 100% information-only, with zero physical consequence: **exit**.
- Identify operational context:
  - [Manned / Unmanned / Remote].
- Map sector failures to FEMA Community Lifelines based on functional impact.

### 4.3 Step 2: Global Mapping & Functional Parity

- 70% parity rule:
  - A mapping is valid if **3 of 4** criteria match:
    - Target (same asset type)
    - Intent (same goal)
    - Hazard (same physical consequence)
    - Phase (same timeline)
- Actions:
  - ≥ 70%: bi-directional mapping between frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO, IEC, NIS2, UK CAF).
  - < 70%: tag `[LOW_PARITY_OUTLIER]`.
- Additional checks:
  - Break-Glass Analysis: identify SOS (Safety Over Security) triggers, if any.
  - Sensor Integrity: evaluate spoofing and verification vulnerabilities.

### 4.4 Step 3: Evolution Review

- If a `[LOW_PARITY_OUTLIER]` is nevertheless highly relevant to Dynamic Risk → raise 🚩`[PROMPT_EVOLUTION_TRIGGER]` with suggested rule updates.

### 4.5 Output Instructions

- **Critical citation rule**:
  - Must include section header, paragraph number, or control identifier (e.g., “AC-3(10)”) *plus* page number to handle PDF vs printed-page offsets.
- Output is a structured Markdown artifact with sections:
  - Document Metadata
  - Resilient Flexibility Analysis
  - Cross-Framework Parity Mapping
  - Flags & Conflicts
  - Extracted Evidence (with precise references)
  - Research Utility & Suggested NotebookLM queries

## 6. Scout Smart Memory Log

Initial design (currently empty, to be populated when the pipeline runs at scale):

- File: `seen_sources.txt` (or similar).
- Purpose:
  - Track **all** documents evaluated by Scout (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
  - Serve as Scout’s memory to avoid re-evaluating the same paper.
  - Provide an auditable sampling log for reproducibility and later analysis.
- Current format:
  - `link|date`
  - (You may optionally extend later to include relevance, source_type, and notes.)

---

## 7. High-Level Evaluation Points (for the Agent to Incorporate)

These are the main suggestions and cautions raised in the discussion, which you plan to feed back into the agent and rules:

1. **Mark rules as provisional**  
   - Explicitly state in `PROJECT_RULES.md` that the tiers, flags, and mappings are working analytic constructs to be refined as the literature is reviewed.

2. **Clarify role of the Dynamic Switch**  
   - Treat Tier 1–3 as an analytic lens, not assumed ground truth; allow documents to map to multiple tiers or none.

3. **Soften and contextualize some mappings and labels**  
   - Handle terms like “Privilege Escalation → Break-Glass” only in clear, contextually justified cases.  
   - Keep strong labels like `[SYSTEMIC_NEGLIGENCE]` as coding categories and reserve normative judgments for human analysis.

4. **Expand what “counts” for grey literature and discovery**  
   - Allow sources that discuss adaptive or conditional safety/security trade-offs, runtime risk decisions, or emergency operating modes even if they don’t use the exact phrase “Dynamic Risk”.

5. **Support “none/unknown” in the template**  
   - Let the auditor explicitly say “No explicit break-glass mechanism” or “Flexibility: Unknown/Not enough evidence” instead of inferring mechanisms where they aren’t clearly present.

6. **Plan a calibration phase**  
   - Before scaling up, manually code a small sample of documents, compare with AI outputs, and adjust:
     - Logic Dictionary
     - Flags
     - Parity rules
     - Flexibility ratings

7. **Enrich Scout’s memory log (optionally)**  
   - Consider extending the log format to:
     - `link | date | relevance | source_type | notes`
   - This would help later with:
     - Describing screening flow
     - Quantifying what was excluded and why
     - Supporting gap analysis (e.g., many IT-only standards, few OT-resilience frameworks).
