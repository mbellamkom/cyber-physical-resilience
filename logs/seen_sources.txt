| [ABCD: A Risk Management Framework for SCADA Systems](https://scholar.dsu.edu/theses/449/) | 2026-02-23 | MEDIUM | The document discusses a risk management framework for SCADA systems, which are relevant cyber-physical concepts (OT/ICS), but does not explicitly detail the tension between safety and security overrides. |
| [Security vs. safety: Why do people die despite good safety?](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7121213/) | 2026-02-23 | HIGH | The title and snippet explicitly discuss the tension and differences between security and safety, directly aligning with the primary thesis criteria for HIGH relevance. |
| [NUARI Technology Integration and Cyber Resilience Symposium](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/html/trecms/AD1153110/) | 2026-02-23 | HIGH | The snippet describes a 'cyber-physical exercise scenario' for 'critical infrastructure' focusing on 'Community Lifelines and Critical Functions,' directly aligning with the mission's emphasis on preventing downstream physical disasters and promoting resilient behaviors in OT-nexus contexts. |
| [Jack Voltaic®](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26954872) | 2026-02-23 | MEDIUM | The snippet discusses 'critical infrastructure resilience' and 'community lifelines,' which are core cyber-physical concepts and align with foundational frameworks like FEMA Lifelines mentioned as a MEDIUM exception, even if direct safety vs. security overrides are not the primary focus. |
| [Jack pandemus–cyber incident and emergency response during a pandemic](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19393555.2021.1980159) | 2026-02-23 | MEDIUM | The document discusses holistic cyber incident response within the context of emergency management, aligning with relevant cyber-physical concepts and emergency workflows, even if it does not explicitly detail safety vs. security override conflicts as its primary thesis. |
| [Towards strategic resilience of process plants and critical infrastructure regarding functional safety and cybersecurity requirements](https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-5f7824e9-c28b-4381-a67b-c9afe039502b) | 2026-02-23 | HIGH | The title explicitly discusses the tension between 'functional safety and cybersecurity requirements' within 'critical infrastructure,' indicating a core focus on the dynamic balance of safety and security in an OT-nexus. |
| [Cybersecurity capabilities for critical infrastructure resilience](https://www.emerald.com/ics/article-abstract/30/2/255/111698) | 2026-02-23 | MEDIUM | The document discusses relevant cyber-physical concepts like ICS cybersecurity and critical infrastructure resilience as its primary focus, but the snippet does not explicitly mention the direct safety vs. security override conflict or adaptive trade-offs. |
| [Cyber-resilient systems for critical infrastructure security in high-risk energy and utilities operations](https://www.allmultidisciplinaryjournal.com/uploads/archives/20250716111112_MGE-2025-4-028.1.pdf) | 2026-02-23 | HIGH | The document's title and snippet explicitly discuss 'cyber-resilient systems' for 'critical infrastructure security' in 'high-risk energy and utilities operations' and 'OT environments,' directly aligning with the project's focus on dynamic risk management and flexible, resilient behaviors in contexts with potential for physical disasters or life-safety concerns. |
| [Developing a Framework to Improve Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity](https://www.nist.gov/document/040813abbpdf) | 2026-02-23 | MEDIUM | The document discusses critical infrastructure and ICS cybersecurity, explicitly mentions 'Safety' as a high priority, and references NIST 800-82, which is a foundational framework for OT security, aligning with the 'MEDIUM' scoring criteria for foundational frameworks and relevant cyber-physical concepts. |
