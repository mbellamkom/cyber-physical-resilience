- **[2026-02-23]** [ICS/SCADA system security for CPS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-75880-0_5)
  - *Rationale:* NO. The text mentions life-safety systems and references standards like IEC 61511 (functional safety) and NIST SP 800-53 (security), but does not explicitly discuss the intersection of engineering safety and cybersecurity in OT environments.

- **[2026-02-23]** [産業用制御システム (ICS) セキュリティガイド](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/research/2016/NISTSP800-82r2_20160314.pdf)
  - *Rationale:* The text focuses on cybersecurity guidance for OT systems (NIST SP 800-53) but does not address life-safety requirements or the integration of fail-safe mechanisms with cybersecurity.

- **[2026-02-23]** [Sp 800-12. an introduction to computer security: The nist handbook](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/2206203)
  - *Rationale:* The text is about general computer security guidance from NIST (SP 800-12), not specifically addressing OT environments, life-safety, fail-safe mechanisms, or the intersection with engineering safety.

- **[2026-02-23]** [The ISM Code: A critical view of the contemporary challenges and future prospects for maritime safety management systems (SMS) in the new digital Era](https://www.jmr.unican.es/jmr/article/view/1252)
  - *Rationale:* The text focuses on maritime safety management systems and human-AI interaction, not specifically on life-safety, fail-safe mechanisms, or the intersection of engineering safety and cybersecurity in OT environments.

- **[2026-02-23]** [The Most Iconic Photographs of All Time - LIFE](https://www.life.com/)
  - *Rationale:* The text is about photo collections and historical visuals, not related to engineering safety or OT environments.

- **[2026-02-23]** [What 20th Century Life Was Like - LIFE](https://www.life.com/lifestyle/)
  - *Rationale:* The text focuses on cultural and social aspects of life, not technical safety mechanisms or cybersecurity in OT environments.

- **[2026-02-23]** [Icons of the 20th Century - LIFE](https://www.life.com/people/)
  - *Rationale:* NO. The text focuses on cultural and historical content unrelated to engineering safety or OT cybersecurity.

- **[2026-02-23]** [LIFE](https://www.life.com/?p=0)
  - *Rationale:* The text is a historical description of a 1938 oil boomtown, containing no technical discussion relevant to the specified safety or cybersecurity topics.
